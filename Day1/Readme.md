# 📘 Golpe Golpe HTML – Episode 1: What is HTML & Why Do We Need It?

Welcome to the very first step in your web development journey!
In this episode, you’ll explore the magical language that builds the web — HTML.

---

## 🔤 What We Learned in This Episode:

* What is HTML?
* Why do we need HTML?
* How does an HTML document begin?
* How to create your first web page?

---

## 💻 Sample Code:

Here's the HTML code we used in this episode:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is my First Webpage</title>
    </head>
</html>
<body>
     <h1>Hello World!!</h1>
     <p>this this my first Html page</p>
</body>
```

❗️Note: In the code above, the <body> tag is placed outside the <html> tag, which is incorrect.

✅ Correct version:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is my First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
